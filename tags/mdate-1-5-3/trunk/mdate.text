  [1m1.  Introduction[0m

  Mdate was written to fill a need: a simple, freely-available program
  for non-academic people interested in the Mayan calendar. Except for
  the Emacs Mayan calendar mode (which has some severe limitations),
  this has been lacking on all popular operating systems, which is odd
  considering the continuing public interest in the Mayan civilisation.

  Mdate has been in continuous development for over four years, mostly
  due to the limited interest in such a program by programmers, but
  fortunately not by users.

  [1m1.2.  History[0m

  The current version of Mdate is 1.5.2, written by Sean Dwyer with help
  from many others over the years.
  The first public version of Mdate was 0.5.0, written in late 1998, and
  was also ported to MS-DOS. Craig Robbins contributed to versions 0.5.1
  to 1.0.0beta1. Version 1.0.0beta1 (1999) was the first GPL version of
  Mdate, and included a Tk interface.

  Mdate 1.0.5 was internationalised, and was quickly followed by version
  1.1.0, also the first version at the new sourceforge.net home.

  Mdate 1.2.0 was modularised into a library (libmdate) and front-ends
  for Tk, command-line and GTK+.

  Mdate 1.2.8 was the last libmdate-dependent and frontend-oriented
  Mdate, by now suffering from too much setup code and neglect.

  Mdate 1.3.0 dropped the libmdate dependence, had a total rewrite in
  C++/C and a much simpler build system, although still missing
  internationalisation support and needing new front-ends.

  Mdate 1.3.4 added a simple translation layer, following the mplayer
  method.

  Mdate 1.4.0 brought in user date formatting (like date(1)), and began
  the process of proper internationalization and configuration., still
  using the example of mplayer.

  The first BeOS port was made in Mdate version 1.4.1.

  Mdate 1.4.2 enhanced the language support by making it a runtime
  choice per an option.

  Mdate 1.4.3 added a mingw32 cross-compiler port and allowed different
  language defaults.

  Mdate 1.4.5 included a compile-time option to use modern Mayan
  calendar month names.

  Mdate 1.4.7 introduced the first FreeBSD (4.9-STABLE) port. The
  program-parseable flag (-p) was rendered defunct when the parseable
  output became the default output format. A new OS X (Mac 32-bit
  console) port also became available.

  Mdate 1.5.2 switched the VC system over to subversion, with intentions
  to open up development with a better multiple developer system.



  [1m2.  Usage[0m

  [1m2.1.  Options[0m

  [1m2.1.1.  Mayan Calendar Names[0m

  From version 1.4.5, a compile-time option was added for those
  preferring the new Romanized Mayan calendar names to the old ones,
  e.g. Kumk'u (new) for Cumku (old) and 'Ahaw (new) for Ahau (old). I'm
  interested in feedback about this option, and whether it could be a
  format item in its own right.


  [1m2.1.2.  Language support[0m

  As at version 1.4.5, mdate supports five languages: English, Spanish,
  German, French and Polish (en, es, de, fr and pl). A runtime option
  was added so you could use a different language. The language support
  is compiled-in and currently ignores environment language variables.

  Example usage:



       $ mdate -L es

       NDJ: 2453168.0 fecha: Fri 11 06 2004  12.19.11.06.03 7 Ak'bal  06 Sots



  The default language is English (en). There is no support for regional
  language subsets (eg en_AU). Other languages may be compiled as the
  default.


  [1m2.1.3.  Output format[0m

  The previous default behaviour of Mdate was to output a formatted
  printout of current date information, using the default Loundsbury
  correlation for today's date:



       $ mdate

       Gregorian Date    : 05-April-2002 (05/04/2002)
       Julian Day Number : 2452370.0
       Long Count        : 12.19.09.02.05
       Tzolkin Date      : 2 Chicchan
       Haab Date         : 3 Uayeb



  However, pretty output formatting is now a compile-time option only,
  due to ongoing problems (i.e. bugs) on several platforms.

  The old -p, --parseable flag is now the default behavior, and outputs
  this information in one line, much like date(1). Example:



       $ mdate

       JDN: 2452370.0 date:  05  04  2002 12.19.09.02.05  02 Chicchan  03 Uayeb



  The parseable flag is now effectively ignored when pretty formatting
  is not compiled in.


  [1m2.1.4.  Date Formatting[0m

  You may want to specify your current date in a specific way, using one
  of mdate's formatting options. Here is the full list:



  @a abbreviated weekday name
  @A full weekday name
  @b abbreviated month name
  @B full month name
  @d weekday (01..31)
  @e weekday without a leading zero
  @F ISO format Gregorian date (%Y-%m-%d)
  @f ISO format Gregorian date (%Y%m%d)
  @h unpadded Haab date
  @H padded Haab date
  @l Long Count
  @M named Gregorian month
  @m numbered Gregorian month
  @t padded Tzolkin date
  @T unpadded Tzolkin date
  @y year as decimal 00 to 99
  @Y Gregorian year
  @n add a newline to the output
  @j add a tab to the output



  Like date(1), mdate will format a date when given a `+' option, for
  example:



       $ mdate -d '07 09 2003' +'@f @l'

       20030907 12.19.10.10.15



  This was specifically requested for those who like to add a Mayan
  byline to emails and web pages. However, mdate has not ever supported
  time of day parsing/formatting, so it's not rfc822 compliant! Most
  formats are merely passed on to strftime(3) where applicable.


  [1m2.1.5.  Correlation Options[0m

  By default, Mdate uses the Loundsbury correlation which is equivalent
  to the Julian Day Number 584285. You're not forced to use this if you
  don't want to.  Here are a couple of options for the correlationally-
  strict :)

  The -g, --gmt option uses the standard Goodman-Martinez-Thompson
  correlation (GMT for short). It corresponds to the Julian Day Number
  584283.

  If you don't agree with either of the above correlation constants, the
  -c, --correlation[=DOUBLE] allows you to specify a correlation of your
  own.  Don't be surprised, however if it doesn't work the way you
  intended, especially if you set the Julian Day Number too low (see the
  ``Limitations'' section to understand why!)


  [1m2.1.6.  Date Input[0m

  You probably want to check a specific date at some point. This can be
  done in several different ways, depending on the kind of date you
  already have.
  The -d, --dmy[="dd mm [-]yyyy"] option allows you to specify a
  Gregorian date. You can also specify negative (BC) years.



       $ mdate -d '05 04 2002'

       JDN: 2452311.0 date: Tues 05 02 2002  12.19.08.17.06 8 Kimi  04 Pax



  In the same way, the -j, --julian=[DOUBLE] option will output the date
  with a specified Julian Day Number:



       $ mdate -j 2452370

       JDN: 2452370.0 date: Fri 05 04 2002  12.19.09.02.05 2 Chik'chan  03 Wayeb



  Notice that you can leave the decimal part out if you wish.

  Finally, the -l, --longcount[="nn nn nn nn nn"] option does the same
  thing with a Mayan long count date input:



       $ mdate -l '12 19 09 02 05'

       JDN: 2452370.0 date: Fri 05 04 2002  12.19.09.02.05 2 Chik'chan  03 Wayeb



  [1m2.1.7.  Miscellaneous Options[0m

  The -h, --help option gives a simple display of help for Mdate.

  The -v, -V, --version option outputs version information for Mdate.


  [1m3.  Limitations[0m

  Mdate does not support any dates beyond the beginning of the current
  epoch (longcount 0.0.0.0.0) matching with the Julian Day Number
  correlation, including Gregorian dates. However, you can have fun with
  correlations, for example:



       $ mdate -c 584285 -j 584285 '+@J @d @m @Y @l @h @t'

       584285.0 13 08 -3113 00.00.00.00.00 8 Kumk'u  04 'Ahaw



  However, the Mayan date above is meaningless :)
