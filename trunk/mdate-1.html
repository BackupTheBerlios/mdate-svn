<P>Mdate was written to fill a need: a simple, freely-available program for
non-academic people interested in the Mayan calendar. Except for the Emacs
Mayan calendar mode (which has some severe limitations), this has been lacking
on all popular operating systems, which is odd considering the continuing
public interest in the Mayan civilisation.</P>
<P>Mdate has been in continuous development for over four years, mostly due to
the limited interest in such a program by programmers, but fortunately not by
users.</P>

</H2>

<P>The current version of Mdate is 1.5.2, written by Sean Dwyer with help from
many others over the years.</P>
<P>The first public version of Mdate was 0.5.0, written in late 1998, and was
also ported to MS-DOS. Craig Robbins contributed to versions 0.5.1 to
1.0.0beta1. Version 1.0.0beta1 (1999) was the first GPL version of Mdate, and
included a Tk interface.</P>
<P>Mdate 1.0.5 was internationalised, and was quickly followed by version 1.1.0,
also the first version at the new sourceforge.net home.</P>
<P>Mdate 1.2.0 was modularised into a library (libmdate) and front-ends for Tk,
command-line and GTK+.</P>
<P>Mdate 1.2.8 was the last libmdate-dependent and frontend-oriented Mdate, by
now suffering from too much setup code and neglect.</P>
<P>Mdate 1.3.0 dropped the libmdate dependence, had a total rewrite in C++/C and
a much simpler build system, although still missing internationalisation
support and needing new front-ends. </P>
<P>Mdate 1.3.4 added a simple translation layer, following the mplayer method.</P>
<P>Mdate 1.4.0 brought in user date formatting (like <CODE>date(1)</CODE>), and began
the process of proper internationalization and configuration., still using the
example of mplayer.</P>
<P>The first BeOS port was made in Mdate version 1.4.1.</P>
<P>Mdate 1.4.2 enhanced the language support by making it a runtime choice per an
option.</P>
<P>Mdate 1.4.3 added a mingw32 cross-compiler port and allowed different
language defaults.</P>
<P>Mdate 1.4.5 included a compile-time option to use modern Mayan calendar month
names.</P>
<P>Mdate 1.4.7 introduced the first FreeBSD (4.9-STABLE) port. The
program-parseable flag (-p) was rendered defunct when the parseable output
became the default output format. A new OS X (Mac 32-bit console) port also
became available.</P>
<P>Mdate 1.5.2 switched the VC system over to subversion, with intentions to open
up development with a better multiple developer system.</P>
